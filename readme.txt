A plug-in that works alongside the CPD Journals plugin that provides default options for when a new journal is created.

== Description ==

A plug-in that works alongside the CPD Journals plugin (http://wordpress.org/plugins/cpd-journals/) that provides default options for when a new journal is created.

= Featured =

* Set assignments, pages and blog posts to be copied to every new journal on creation
* Add assignments and pages to the menu on the new journal automatically.
* Assignments are defined as any page that sits under a page with a slug of 'assignment'

See the screenshots for usage instuctions.

= Credits =

This plugin was developed by [Make Do](http://makedo.in) based on the original [CPD Journals plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/cpd-journals/) plugin by [Saul Cozens](http://saulcozens.co.uk) of [CZN Digital](http://czndigital.com), but was paid for by [Sheffield University](http://shef.ac.uk) who requested that it be written to be useful to other organisations as well and released to the community as Open Source. Thank you to them.

== Installation ==

1. Backup your WordPress install
2. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Screenshots ==

1. In my test CPD system, I have only the default site set up.
2. Logged in as an network admin I can see the new options page under setting titled 'CPD journal defaults' This screen will be where we state which pages will be automatically created when a new journal is created. However we have not set up any templates as yet (templates work in the same way that they work in the Copy Assignments plugin).
3. I create new pages in my default site titled 'Assignments', 'Page Templates' and 'Post Templates' I then create draft pages under each of these headings.
4. When I go back to the CPD journal defaults page, I can now choose assignments, pages and blog posts that will be copied to my new journals.
5. Choosing one of the templates enables me to also add it to the journal menu.
6. Checking the 'Add to menu' box enables me to set the order it should appear in the menu.
7. I select several items, note that although I have selected the page 'Portfolio' I have not indicated that it should be added to the menu. Don't forget to save these defaults. You can always change them later. 
8. Next create a new user, using the normal CPD workflow.
9. Set them as a participant and create a new journal. It is when we create the new journal that the items we previously selected will be copied across.
10. We can see that the CPD workflow was successful, and we now have a new journal titled 'participant'.
11. If you view the posts on this new journal, you will see that the post templates we selected have been copied across. Note that they have been created as the participant.
12. You will also note that the pages and assignments we selected have been copied into the 'pages' section of the journal. Also note these have been created as the participant. 
13. If we go into the 'Appearance > Menus' part of the journal, you will see that the pages and assignments that we wished to be added to the menu have been added in the order we selected. The 'Portfolio' page that we did not check has been left off of the menu.
14. If we look at the top of the screen of the journal, you will see that the items have been added to the menu.
